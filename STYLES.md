# Architecture of Consoles Style Sheet (beta)

## General:

#### Titles
Minimum capitalisation
#### "Acronym Expanded Form (AEF)"
Expand acronyms as shown. This first use of an acronym within a piece should be expanded.
Common computing acronyms (like CPU, RAM) are assumed to be understood by the reader.
#### Using 'ise'-type British spellings. No capital after colon.
#### No Oxford/serial comma
(Except where absolutely needed for clarity)
#### Measurements
Abbreviations to be spaced (e.g. 60 KB).
MHz
MB
GB
KB

## Vocabulary:

#### 'Writings' 
Important to author voice. Do not change except where certainly incorrect.
#### "on the fly"
No hyphen.
#### Waveforms
One word.
#### Address bus
Capped down (address bus).


## Guidance:
#### "However,"
'However' should always has a comma after it when used like 'but'. This mnemonic shows why:
> However, they survived = "But they survived"
> However they survived = "They survived, but we don't know how, and we're about to talk about something else".
#### Capitalisation
Be ruthless with removing capitalisation.
