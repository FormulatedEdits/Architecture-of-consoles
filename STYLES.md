# Architecture of Consoles Style Sheet (beta)

## General:

#### Titles
Minimum capitalisation: "This is an example, Playstation 3". Expand acronyms in titles where reasonable.

#### Acronyms
The first use of an acronym within a piece should be expanded as shown: "Acronym Expanded Form (AEF)". Other similar forms are also acceptable (e.g. Acronym Expanded Form, or AEF,..)

Where an acronym is used in passing, it needn't be expanded if doing so would clutter the text, as long as its relevance to the point at hand is clear. Inserting an explanatory link is also acceptable.

Where an acronym is defined later (in a more appropriate place) in the same piece, it's acceptable to say so and defer defining it.

Common computing acronyms are assumed to be understood by the reader. Examples: KB, GB (etc.), CPU, GPU, RAM, ROM, VoIP, MIDI, MP3, AAC, SDK(?), API(?), D-Pad, USB, DRM.

If an acronym is being used far away from its first definition, it is acceptable to remind the reader of its meaning. This can be done in any appropriate way, but the cleanest is to use the full form (with capitals) once, and then return to using the acronym.

#### Numbers
Spell from zero up to ten, and at the beginnings of sentences. From 11 onwards and mid-sentence, use numerals. (In practice very few numbers will be spelled. See the exceptions below.)
Measurements to be given as numerals (e.g. 4 GB)
Be consistent within sentences â€“ use numerals in such cases (e.g. The 90 giraffes all had only 4 legs each). This can be applied across sentences if a comparison is being made (e.g. The Namibian millipede has 99 legs. The giraffe only has 4).
Do not change proper for nouns (e.g. Playstation 3, not Playstation Three)
~ is acceptable in notes and parentheses.

#### Using 'ise'-type British spellings.
#### Measurements and units
Abbreviations to be spaced (e.g. 60 KB).
MHz
MB
GB
KB
#### Latin abbreviations
Point between lowercase letters (e.g.)
No following comma (e.g. like this)
Latin abbreviations should be avoided in running text but are acceptable in parentheses, bullet points and captions.
#### Bullet points
Each item to be punctuated with a full stop.

## Punctuation:

#### Colon
No following capital (: example).
#### Ellipsis
No leading space (like... this)
#### No Oxford/serial comma
(Except where absolutely needed for clarity)
#### Quotes
Single quotes, with double quotes within (British style). New terms (but not acronyms) in running text (not titles or captions) to be introduced in quotes; otherwise quotes should be used sparingly.

## Vocabulary:

#### 'Writings' 
Important to author voice. Do not change except where certainly incorrect.
#### "On the fly"
No hyphen.
#### Waveforms
One word, no hyphen.
#### Address bus
Capped down (address bus).
#### "32-bit X"
With hyphen. Same for 12-bit, etc.
The hyphen is kept for a descriptor, but dropped for a measurement (e.g. the 12-bit X holds 12 bits).
#### S-Video
Capitalised S and V.
#### D-pad
Capitalised D.
#### WiFi
No hypen.
#### PSP Specific Vocab
Tachyon, Kirk, Spock
The Allegrex (cf. 'the Core i7')
#### Flash memory
Capital 'F' to distinguish from the usual meaning of flash.

## Guidance:
#### "However,"
'However' should always has a comma after it when used like 'but'. This mnemonic shows why:
> However, they survived = "But they survived"
> However they survived = "They survived, but we don't know how, and we're about to talk about something else".
#### Capitalisation
Be ruthless in removing capitalisation. This is particularly important in technical fields, where capitalisation is already more common than usual, and can proliferate with the addition of each new term. Capitals should only be used for proper nouns, acronyms (including where defining them, e.g. Acronym Expanded Form (AEF)), and sentence initials.
#### 'Having said that' and 'that said'
These are usually used to introduce a contrast (e.g. Jack has some bad points, but having said that, he helped me move house.) Where wrapping up and moving on, these might do instead:
"Now that we've established that,"
"Bearing that/the above in mind,"
"Now we know how X works,"
"Moving on,"
#### Article subject/title reminders
It's a good idea in long web articles to remind the reader of the topic (i.e. which console you're discussing) from time to time.

## Queries and questions:
#### Tenses
(Under consideration)
The tenses jump around a bit in some pieces. It's worth considering standardising this across all pieces, according to a system (perhaps using past tense unless there is a specific reason not to).

#### Bullet points
Some bullet points begin with a bold section that ends in a colon. This section could be regarded as a title of sorts. After such a title it could be regarded as correct to capitalise the initial of the following matter, i.e. cap after colon. I haven't implemented this as it would be inconsistent with other colon usage.
