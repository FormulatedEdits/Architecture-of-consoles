# Architecture of Consoles Style Sheet (beta)

## General:

#### Titles
Minimum capitalisation: "This is an example".
#### Acronyms
Acronyms should usually be expanded as shown: "Acronym Expanded Form (AEF)". An acronym can also be given as an aside: "Acronym Expanded Form, or AEF".

The first use of an acronym within a piece should be expanded. (Where an acronym is used in passing, it needn't always be expanded so long as its relevance to the point at hand is clear.)

Common computing acronyms are assumed to be understood by the reader. Examples: GB (etc.), CPU, RAM.

If an acronym is being used far away from its first definition, it is acceptable to remind the reader of its meaning. This can be done via an aside or direct reminder, or by using the full form (with capitals, e.g. Graphics Engine) once, and then returning to using the acronym.

#### Using 'ise'-type British spellings.
#### No Oxford/serial comma
(Except where absolutely needed for clarity)
#### Measurements and units
Abbreviations to be spaced (e.g. 60 KB).
MHz
MB
GB
KB
#### Latin abbreviations
Point between lowercase letters (e.g.)
No following comma (e.g. like this)
Latin abbreviations should be avoided in running text but are acceptable in parentheses, bullet points and captions


## Punctuation

#### Colon
No following capital (: example).
#### Ellipsis
No leading space (like... this)


## Vocabulary:

#### 'Writings' 
Important to author voice. Do not change except where certainly incorrect.
#### "On the fly"
No hyphen.
#### Waveforms
One word.
#### Address bus
Capped down (address bus).
#### "32-bit X"
With hyphen. Same for 12-bit, etc.
The hyphen is kept for a descriptor, but dropped for a measurement (e.g. the 12-bit X holds 12 bits).


## Guidance:
#### "However,"
'However' should always has a comma after it when used like 'but'. This mnemonic shows why:
> However, they survived = "But they survived"
> However they survived = "They survived, but we don't know how, and we're about to talk about something else".
#### Capitalisation
Be ruthless in removing capitalisation. This is particularly important in technical fields, where capitalisation is already more common usual, and can proliferate with the addition of each new term. Capitals should only be used for proper nouns, acronyms (including where defining them, e.g. Acronym Expanded Form (AEF)) and sentence initials.

## Queries
#### Tenses:
I notice that the tenses jump around quite a lot. I need more experience and training to deal with this correctly. It's possible that no changes need to be made.
Rough observations: 
Consoles are usually referred to in the past tense. Components in the context of hardware development are also referred to in the past tense, but components in-console are referred to in the present tense. Developing software for those compenents is referred to in the future tense.
